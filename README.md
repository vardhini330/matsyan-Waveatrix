# 🌊 AquaSentinel - Overfishing Alert & Monitoring System

> A real-time zone-based fishing violation alert and monitoring dashboard built for authorities to track overfishing and restricted zone breaches using a vibrant and multilingual web interface.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Overfishing and unauthorized entry into marine protected zones threaten biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods. Traditional monitoring systems are costly, slow, and often lack real-time capabilities. There is a need for a **low-cost, real-time alert system** to monitor fishing activities, **track violations**, and **warn boats** instantly — especially in regional languages like Tamil, Hindi, and English.
